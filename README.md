## Spring LinkedInLearning Security

My Java Spring collected solutions I completed in my Spring Boot Security LinkedIn Learning coursework completed in 2022. 
Here in this repository we attempt to allow specific users to authenticate before allowing retrieval of order information 
from an imaginary business called "Landon Industries"

Lessons Learned: 

- How to hide web pages behind "basic auth" login prompts controlled by the browser. 
- How to hide web pages behind "forms-based" authentication login forms coded in HTML and data collected through HTTP post.
- How to hide web pages behind OpenLDAP authentication login forms coded in HTML, and configured via LDIF.
